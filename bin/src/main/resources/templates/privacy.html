			<p>
			<h3>Welcome!</h3>
			Stripe provides economic infrastructure for the internet. Businesses
			of all sizes use our software and services to accept payments and
			manage their businesses online. Stripe cares about the security and
			privacy of the personal data that is entrusted to us.
			<p />
			<p>
				This policy describes the <strong>Personal Data</strong> that we
				collect, how we use and share it, your rights and choices, and how
				you can contact us about our privacy practices.
			</p>
			<p>
				Stripe ("Stripe", "we", "our" or "us") provides its services
				globally and the Stripe entity responsible for the collection and
				use of personal data under this Privacy Policy differs <strong>depending
					on your country</strong>.
			</p>
			<p>
				We may collect and use personal data when we do business with you or
				when you do business with those that use our services. Some of our
				services may be accessed directly by you, including through our
				websites that reference this policy (e.g. <strong>TechnicalTest.com</strong>)
				(collectively "Sites"). Many of our services are provided to others
				in connection with their own business and activities, and you may
				engage with Stripe services as part of another's service, such as
				when you make a payment to a merchant and we provide the payment
				processing services to that merchant through <strong>TechnicalTest
					Checkout</strong> (collectively, we refer to Sites and direct and indirect
				services as "Services"). This policy applies to Stripe's own
				Services. Websites, products and services of third-parties and some
				affiliates of Stripe are subject to their own separate privacy
				policies.
